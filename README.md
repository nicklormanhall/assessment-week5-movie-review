PLANNING

We initially discussed options for our project with each person adding suggestions, we ended up deciding on Movies released in 2024.

As part of our set up we created a new discord channel, a figma project for the wireframe and a trello board.

We made two different wireframe designs for the front sheet, as a group we decided on design 2, then added a wireframe design for a second page
